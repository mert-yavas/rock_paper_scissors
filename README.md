# Rock Paper Scissors
## Overview

Hello! I'm Mert, and this is the fourth project in my "100 Days of Python" challenge. "Rock Paper Scissors" is a classic game implemented in Python. In this game, you'll compete against the computer in a simple yet entertaining match of Rock Paper Scissors.

## How it Works

The game is straightforward:

You will be prompted to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors.
The computer will randomly choose its option.
The game will then reveal both choices and declare the winner based on traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules:
Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
If you and the computer choose the same, it's a draw. The game is a fun way to test your luck and decision-making skills against a computer opponent.

# Visuals
The game includes ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors to visually enhance the gaming experience. Each choice is represented by a unique hand gesture, adding an amusing touch to the gameplay.

# Try It Out
Run the script, make your choice, and see if you can outsmart the computer. Each round is unpredictable, offering a fun and quick gaming experience. Enjoy the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors with a digital twist!
